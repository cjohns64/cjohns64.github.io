    <h2>World Class Equine Website</h2>
    <p>Redesigned and built the World Class Equine website using the Hugo static site generator. I am particularly proud of the fact that this site uses no JavaScript but still has complex features such as image sliders.</p><br>

    <h2>CS 510 Game Programming Project</h2>
    <h3>Proof-of-concept build:</h3>
    <p>The playable proof-of-concept of this project is extremely buggy, and the progression systems have not yet been implemented. I worked mostly on the ship asset, the inventory system, and the menus.</p><br>

    <h3>Alpha build:</h3>
    <p>I almost completely refactored the inventory system for the alpha build. The game is much closer to having a single area implemented, but the main progression systems are not yet functional. I worked on the inventory and upgrade system, as well as all the assets.</p><br>

    <h3>Beta build:</h3>
    <p>For this build I reworked the player menus, built a main menu, worked on a system for transitioning between zones, and almost finished the progression system. We decided to change the scope of the game from a trading game to a delivery game, since an economy would have added unnecessary complexity. However, we discovered too late that the new shader for the orbit lines was not compatible with webgl, so this version ended up even less playable then the alpha, despite being a lot more stable.</p><br>

    <h3>Final build:</h3>
    <p>In this build the orbit lines were reverted to their alpha state, and the game finally has a full feature set. Sound was added and several quality of life features were also implemented.</p><br>
