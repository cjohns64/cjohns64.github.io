      <title>Data Science Final Project</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the final project for CS 670 Data Science my teammate and I decided to analyze the distributions and characteristics of exoplanets in the NASA Exoplanet Archive dataset. I worked mostly on sections 2.4-2.8. My contributions primarily concerned the 3D plotting of the exoplanets. The 3D coordinates of the exoplanet observations were not part of the original dataset, so I used the Sesame Name Resolver to lookup the exoplanets coordinates from the name of their host star. I was then able to make a user-interactive 3D plot of the data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited to present a poster at NCUR (National Council on Undergraduate Research) 2020, but the event was canceled due to COVID. My research poster discusses the possibility of using tetrapod nano crystals as a strain-tunable single photon source and the process I went through to try and measure that using a Hanbury Brown &amp;amp; Twiss Interferometer. I made the graphics myself using a combination of Blender and Inkscape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
