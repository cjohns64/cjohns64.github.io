  <h2 id="hex-chess-project-summary">Hex Chess Project Summary</h2>
<p>I made this game during the 2025 Spring term for CS 507 final project. I wanted to make a chess game, since I had previously attempted to make one in Java in 2015 when I just started to learn programming. I quickly learned the realities of a large scale programming project with this attempt and the project was eventually abandoned. I wanted to re-visit the idea utilizing the lessons I had learned as well as adding a twist, the board would be hexagonal.</p>
<p>I also took this opportunity to teach myself C++. I had no prior experience with it, so I decided to audit a C++ programming course that term. I originally intended to make a 3D &ldquo;user interface&rdquo; using the Unity Game Engine, but halfway through the term I began to have issues with Unity. This was the motivating reason for me to start learning Godot. I&rsquo;d heard that Godot supports C++ code and I was interested in it since it is a free-and-open-source project that is more in line with my values.</p>
<p>The chess project went together in two stages. First, I built a pure C++ command-line application for running the chess game. Second, I built a Godot game that acted as a user interface for the C++ application. This was accomplished using the Godot GDExtension system. The command-line application was debugged using gdb, which allowed me to check every line of execution and catch most of the bugs. This is probably the most bug-free project I have done. I did experience some difficulties compiling the GDExtension with SCons, this is the main reason why the game is only available as a Linux executable.</p>
<h2 id="project-take-aways">Project Take-Aways</h2>
<ul>
<li>I really like C++</li>
<li>Pointers are incredible</li>
<li>Slow methodical coding saves more time then it takes and leads to better results</li>
<li>It would likely have been faster to build the whole game in GDScript rather then the C++/GDScript hybrid I ended up making</li>
</ul>
