    <h2 id="one-armed-bandit-project-summery">One-Armed Bandit! Project Summery</h2>
<p>For this project, our three-member team decided to make the game in 2D. In the prior two game jams we made 3D games and we struggled to get a working prototype done before the deadline. This turned out to be a great decision since a 2D game can be made about 100 times faster then a 3D game. We also had a great starting idea that ended up being relatively easy to implement. I made most of the art for the game (except the houses, fences, and food sprites). The art was made by modeling a simple 3D mesh in Blender and rendering it into a sprite sheet using the Sequenced Bake plugin. This turned out to be another great decision since it allowed for the detail of a 3D game combined with the ease of developing a 2D game.</p>

<p>This game is structurally quite complex and was effectively a masterclass in Godot&rsquo;s raycast system. Since the pillars are all contained in the same mesh and there are over 96 different ones on each level, the traditional methods of referencing the objects couldn&rsquo;t work for this project. We ended up developing a system where the normal direction of the top surface of each pillar section would be used as a key to uniquely identify that pillar. This was combined with aggressive use of Godot&rsquo;s collision layers which allowed us to use raycasts from the origin to select the pillars.</p>

    <h2 id="mall-crawlers-project-summery">Mall Crawlers Project Summery</h2>
<p>This game was made for the Godot Wild Jam #83. This was the first game jam I participated in. Our team of three people severely underestimated the time required to implement the vision we had for this project, so it ended up as more of a tech demo then a game. I spent most of my time working on making the assets, the level design, and the animation blend trees. I also did the light baking, this had a huge effect on the atmosphere of the game, but is also responsible for most of it&rsquo;s file size.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/games/hex-chess/">Hex Chess</a></h2>
    <h2 id="hex-chess-project-summary">Hex Chess Project Summary</h2>
<p>I made this game during the 2025 Spring term for CS 507 final project. I wanted to make a chess game, since I had previously attempted to make one in Java in 2015 when I just started to learn programming. I quickly learned the realities of a large scale programming project with this attempt and the project was eventually abandoned. I wanted to re-visit the idea utilizing the lessons I had learned as well as adding a twist, the board would be hexagonal.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/games/interstellar-delivery-service/">Interstellar Delivery Service</a></h2>
    <h2 id="interstellar-delivery-service-project-summary">Interstellar Delivery Service Project Summary</h2>
<p>This game was made for the final project for CS 510 Game Programming. It was made in the Unity Game Engine in C#.</p>
<p>The game was develop in four stages throughout the term: prof-of-concept, alpha, beta, and final.</p>
<p>During the proof-of-concept stage I worked on the ship asset, the inventory system, and the inventory/trading menus.</p>
<p>In the Alpha stage I almost completely refactored the inventory system, added an upgrade system, and added assets for the planets, asteroids, and stations in zone 1.</p>
